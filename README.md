# H-Series Workshop for ORNL, August 2024

This repository contains notebooks to use nexus to access H-Series as well as notebooks to run H-Series use-cases.

## Important

* All workshop users can access the the ORNL Workshop org with a "+ornl" alias, ex. your.email+ornl@quantinuum.com.
* Access to the [Quantinuum Nexus UMUI](https://nexus.quantinuum.com/) or authentication via `qnexus` should use those credentials.
* This is a separate organization from standard ORNL access in order to minimize cross-utilization of resources. 
* Access will be removed upon conclusion of the workshop.

## Install qnexus

`qnexus` is the python client to access H-Series devices via the Quantinuum Nexus platform. `qnexus` can be installed with the command below. To access Nexus and H-Series resources, the user must be authenticated with Nexus credentials.

```
pip install qnexus
```
